## Monday 6th April 2020

Welcome everyone to our new project: AceBook! Which we wished had something to do with Poker cards, but instead it's a "clone" of Facebook, which is pretty cool too.

Talking about cool things, let me introduce our beautiful team: Nima, Sophia, Rafa and Jara (myself) which looks like a great combination and I'm sure we will have a lot of fun together! (And some work done too I guess). This is our second group project while at Makers, and the first one lasting for two whole weeks. Having so much time to focus in one same thing looks very promising towards managing to get something (not too bad) working.

For those reading this in the future, the date on top may not mean anything special, but it does for us. We have been working from home for three weeks already as we are living the Covid-19 lockdown. What does this mean? Good things (working with pijama trousers), bad things (biscuits intake growing way too fast) and extra challenges: doing a group project fully remote! But we are mastering GitHub after all this weeks, so commits, merge and pull request are no longer a mistery to us. Also Zoom for screen sharing and remote screen control, and our lovely [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/adiRFheq/the-undefined-method) are awesome tools.

This morning we kicked off the week with all our cohort and then got started in our groups. First things first, fork the project repo, clone it and install everything we needed. We also discussed how to keep track of our work in a visual way, and that's were our Trello comes in! Then we created a team charter discussing the ways to make work productive and create a safe environment for all of us.

To finish with our project set up we divided the roles so that they will rotate amongst us and same with the pairs for each day. This way we will all experience all the roles and work with everyone. Finally we all agreed in the distribution of the working hours and breaks, and how to deal with the weekend and bank holidays we were going to go through.

Another challenge this week? First time for all of us working with Ruby on Rails framework and Active Records, which looks a bit scary, but we made a list of Trello cards to share learning resources and all kind of interesting links, so we have this! To start covering this up we decided to split up for the last hour and make some reading on Rails documentation.

And, after a quick retro, day was over, time flies when you have so many things to do, and here I am, sitting in my terrace wrapping up the very last line of code of the day. Buenas noches!
